# 🚀 RepairShop — Flutter App

**RepairShop** is a hybrid mobile application built using **Flutter Clean Architecture**, designed for managing repair tasks and team collaboration in a repair shop environment. It supports multiple user roles including **Admin**, **Manager**, and **Employee** — each with distinct responsibilities.

This README covers the **frontend** portion of the app, built entirely using **Flutter**.

## 🧠 App Architecture

The project follows **Flutter Clean Architecture** principles with a clear separation of concerns:

```

lib
├── core # App-wide utilities, themes, error handling, and shared logic
├── features # Feature-specific folders (auth, tasks, techNotes)
├── init_dependencies.dart
└── main.dart

```

### ✅ Layered Breakdown

- **Core Layer:**
  Contains common utilities, theming, networking, error models, and cubits used globally.

- **Feature Layer:**
  Divided by feature domain:
  - `auth` — Login, signup, and user state management
  - `task` — Task assignment, listing, and status updates
  - `techNotes` — Notes related to repairs and technical details

---

## 👥 User Roles

- **Admin:** Can create other users (admin, manager, employee).
- **Manager:** Can assign tasks to employees and create users (excluding admin).
- **Employee:** Can view and add tasks and notes, and receive assignments.
